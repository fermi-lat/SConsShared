To use SCons to build a superpackage 
* make or go to a top level directory, say my_root
* Populate with packages, e.g. use repoman with a call like
    repoman checkout ScienceTools_User-scons 
or
    repoman checkout ScienceTools_User-scons  GRINF-79
(GRINF-79 is a branch in ScienceTools_User repo)
   
* set environment variable GLAST_EXT appropriately (not necessary,
  but may be more convenient than typing path in SCons command)
* build a target like this:
   scons -C ScienceTools_User-scons --site-dir=../SConsShared/site_scons --with-GLAST-EXT=$GLAST_EXT  the-target

where "the-target" may be "all", a package name, etc.   The special target
"NoTarget" may be used to see if SConscripts, etc., pass syntax check
without actually building anything.

To use --supersede, checkout a base release, say under directory base_root
Create your supersede directory, say super_root and clone packages you need to work on there.

To build, cd to base_root and issue command similar to above except with --supersede option, e.g.

   scons -C ScienceTools_User-scons --site-dir=../SConsShared/site_scons --with-GLAST-EXT=$GLAST_EXT --supersede=full-abspath-to-super_root  the-target
