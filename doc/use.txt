To use SCons to build a superpackage 
* make or go to a top level directory, say my_root
* Populate with packages, e.g. use repoman with a call like
    repoman checkout ScienceTools_User-scons 
or
    repoman checkout ScienceTools_User-scons  GRINF-79
(GRINF-79 is a branch in ScienceTools_User repo)
   
* set environment variable GLAST_EXT appropriately (not necessary,
  but may be more convenient than typing path in SCons command)
* build a target like this:
   scons -C ScienceTools_User-scons --site-dir=../SConsShared/site_scons --with-GLAST-EXT=$GLAST_EXT  the-target

where "the-target" may be "all", a package name, etc.   The special target
"NoTarget" may be used to see if SConscripts, etc., pass syntax check
without actually building anything.
